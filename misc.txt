✅ Merge dev → main (release moment 🚀)
Only when: app works

git checkout main
git merge dev
git push

==================================================================================
✅ Correct mental model (after release)

main → released / stable
dev → ongoing development (long-living)
feature/*, fix/* → short-living

So:
dev lives forever
feature & fix branches get deleted

🔁 After merging dev → main, what next?
🔹 Step 1: Switch back to dev
        git checkout dev

🔹 Step 2: Bring dev up to date with main
This is the MOST IMPORTANT STEP.
        git merge main
(or, if you prefer cleaner history later, you can rebase — but merge is perfect for now)

🔹 Step 3: Push updated dev
        git push

Now:
main ✅ stable
dev ✅ synced
Ready for next work
